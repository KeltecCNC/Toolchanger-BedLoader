# Toolchanger-BedLoader
Approved for Release By George Kellgren 2021-8-2 TSO.

    DESCRIPTION:
Modification of the E3Dtoolchanger 3D printer to allow automatic bed loading and unloading for unattended printing. Printer requires spacers to move the Z axis forward, other than that, only parts are added to the machine. Majority of purchased parts came from Mcmaster Carr.
Beds are spring steel, with sanded garolite on top. There are 4 strips of double layer garolite on the corners that allow the beds to stack in the magazine without touching the bed adhesive. 2 servos slide the bed forward which allows it to drop onto the conveyor belt made of round rubber belting. Stepper motor setup as a mcahine axis then can move the bed to the right.
Beds attach to the heated bed with 4 magnets on the corners bolted to a frame connected the bed assembly. The Z axis lowers below the belt which also lowers a stop depending on the final resting spot of the Z axis.
After the print is done it goes to the left and then is lifted and angled to slide forwards with a Heavy duty servo, and then the bed can slide down the stacking area in front of the machine.
